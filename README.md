# Animated-Bouncing-Ball

Here, I’m using Visual Python to understand better a real-world process. Granted, the physics of a bouncing ball may not be the biggest mystery in the universe, but the exercise of representing real-world processes computationally often helps you understand that particular process better.

## Using The vpython Module to Simulate A Bouncing Ball in Python

It’s most fun and most instructive to work on this simulation from the basic principles. The vpython module is a brilliant tool to create such physical simulations as it’s relatively straightforward to use, and it gives you full control over whatever happens in your animation.

- Firstly create all sides of the walls using box function.
- Create a instance of ball using sphere function and set its parameters.
- Finally you create an infinite loop and change the coordinates of the ball.
